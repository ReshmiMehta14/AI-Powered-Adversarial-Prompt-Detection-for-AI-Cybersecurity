# AI-Powered-Adversarial-Prompt-Detection-for-AI-Cybersecurity
A multi-layered AI solution using regex, NLP, GPT analysis, and ML to detect adversarial prompts like prompt injection, data exfiltration, and code execution. Features real-time analysis, educational logs, and visual insights for cybersecurity defense.


## Overview
This project is a multi-layered AI-powered AI security detection system designed to identify adversarial prompts using a combination of regex, NLP, GPT analysis, and machine learning. It provides real-time detection and analysis of malicious prompts, simulating a red team environment to detect attacks like prompt injection, data exfiltration, code execution, and more.

This tool is essential for organizations to test AI vulnerabilities, enhance AI security, and prevent AI misuse. With a user-friendly dashboard, it also serves as an educational resource to understand adversarial AI threats.

##  **Technical Architecture**

The detection system consists of the following components:

### 1. **Detection Engine (detection.py)**
- **Regex-Based Detection**: Identifies known attack patterns.
- **NLP Analysis**: Analyzes sentence structure for suspicious intent.
- **GPT Analysis**: Provides AI-driven assessment for ambiguous prompts.
- **ML Model**: Trained on labeled prompts for precise classification.

### 2. **Red Team Prompt Generation (redteamgeneratedqueries.py)**
- Uses GPT to generate adversarial prompts for red team simulations.

### 3. **Logging (logger.py)**
- Records prompt inputs, classifications, and analysis results.

### 4. **Testing (test.py)**
- Simulates attacks, tests detection accuracy, and stores logs.

### 5. **Dashboard (dashboard.py)**
- Provides a Streamlit-based interface for real-time chat detection, visualization, and log analysis.
